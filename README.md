# Multi-writing-system-toki-pona-syllable-keyboard-android
Use sitelen pona, unicode-based psuedo sitelen pona, and sitelen jelo (emoji), as well as regular latin 

INSTRUCTIONS!!:

1. Install Multiling O keyboard using the link provided or searching it in the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kl.ime.oh

2. (Optional!) Install the toki pona keyboard plugin named "android-klyeplugintp1-10.apk", for latin-script autocorrect. I'm not actually sure if this works with my layout so you can most likely skip this step. I found it at the link below but I uploaded it here as well.

3. Enable and select the keyboard through the app

Now, all we need to do is import a few bits of text, change one setting, and you'll be on your way.

4. Click the file: "toki-pona-keyboard-layout.json" click the three dots on right above it, select copy

4a. Now open the app, go to test, click the Test text box. Hold the space bar, drag to layouts, click [+DIY], click paste, then ok. (you may have to reopen this to select the layout after vreating

You should now have the layout

5. Copy the text contained inside "toki-pona-keyboard-layout.json" the same way as before. Open the app again.

5a. Go to settings within the app > misc > import|export > theme and import. Now paste and hit ok.


Almost done! Just one more step so you can write sitelen pona!


6. Click "autotext-sitelenpona.txt" on this page, click the three dots to copy the text inside. 

6a. Open the app once more, Settings>Autotext>Paste>Ok

You're done! Enjoy the keyboard, I hope it works well. Feel free to leave feedback publicly or privately on Reddit or Discord, I made this because nothing like it existed. 

Discord: tetros0, also on the tokipona discord :)
