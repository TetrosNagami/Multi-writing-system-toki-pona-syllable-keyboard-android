# Multi-writing-system-toki-pona-syllable-keyboard-android
Use sitelen pona, unicode-based psuedo sitelen pona, and sitelen jelo (emoji), as well as regular latin 

INSTRUCTIONS!!:

1. Install Multiling O keyboard using the link provided or searching it in the Play Store: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=kl.ime.oh


2. Enable and select the keyboard through the app


(Now, all we need to do is import a few bits of text, change one setting, and you'll be on your way.)


3. Click the file: "toki-pona-keyboard-layout.json" click the three dots on right above it, select copy


4a. Now open the app, go to test, click the Test text box. Hold the space bar, drag to layouts, click [+DIY], click paste, then ok.


(You should now have the layout installed, it may? glitch and look weird upon loading but it should stop fairly soon once you press a key or reopen the keyboard.)


(Almost done! Just one more step so you can write sitelen pona!)


5. Click "autotext-sitelenpona.txt" on this page, click the three dots to copy the text inside. 

5a. Open the app once more Settings>Autotext>Paste>Ok

(You're done! Enjoy the keyboard, I hope it works well. Feel free to leave feedback publicly or privately on Reddit or Discord, I made this because nothing like it existed.)

(OPTIONAL!) Dark theme: copy the text of the theme file and then open the app. go to settings>misc>import>theme paste ok.



you will need a font to see the ucsur sitelen pona writing suggestions if you dont have it already. alternatively there are unicode pseudo sitelen pona for you to use that anyone can see, no special font required, or emoji writing. 

Discord: tetros0, also on the tokipona discord :)
